1. Convolution - Process of going through the pixels of input image to reshape it for further analysis
2. Filters/Kernels - Filters (also called Kernels) used to extract distinctive features of an image
3. Epochs - In each epoch all input image samples are analyzed for training a model
4. 1*1 Convolution - Usually used for reducing the number of channels to arrive at more meaningful info
5. 3*3 convolution - Used to extracting edges, patterns, textures, shapes and objects
6. Feature Maps - Channel output after a convolution is completed
7. Activation Function - Applied with a convolution to focus on certain aspect more than others
8. Receptive Field - How many pixels of orignal image is visible
